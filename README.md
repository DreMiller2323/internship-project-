This project is for my current internship I landed with Be Club interns, 
The app currently as of this read me I just wrapped up my database and and running my backend and front-end inside the same Next App.
The next feature I will complete authentication and will set up my powerlifting plan creater where a user can get an estimate on their one rep max, give them a weight training plan based off there goals of gaining strength
building muscle, all calculated from their one rep max. 
The power of next takes the old days of mixing together express with react and the confusion, next uses a file based routing system making it much easier to navigate the pages and is way less headache. 
The next step ill add authenticator and the bodybuilder calculator! let me know how I can improve my code thank you!
